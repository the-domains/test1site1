**_Chief Data Scientist, Online Media_**

Our client, a multi-billion dollar conglomerate, seeks a Chief Data Scientist for their hugely successful online media subsidiary to help them continue their explosive growth.

**_The client:_**

The client is a household name --- it has created one of the top 20 most downloaded apps of all time, and you have almost certainly used their parent company's products, likely with regularity.  And if you don't use the subsidiary's app, it's all but guaranteed you know multiple people who do.

**_The opportunity:_**

Our client seeks a Chief Data Scientist for their sub to help them analyze and leverage user data to seek and exploit opportunities for growth while proactively identifying and solving complex business problems using a variety of tools ranging from Hadoop, NoSQL and next generation data warehouses for unstructured data and SAS and SQL for structured data.  Daily data is massive -- hundreds of millions of new datapoints daily -- with tremendous user engagement and a growth curve faster than even Facebook or LinkedIn.  Data is both structured and unstructured.

Structure of the position is largely open --- the client is open to anyone who has managed massively large data sets of structured and unstructured data and small/high powered teams of data scientists and can/has presented to high level executives to obtain buy-in to their ideas and findings.

Reporting line is to the CIO with a matrix in to the CEO.

**_Requirements_**

* A Master's (minimally) or PhD in a quantitative field with very strong use of technology tools for managing massive data sets, ideally in a data science related discipline like machine learning, but will also consider physics, mathematics, statistics, meteorology or any appropriate discipline enabling the application of higher order mathematics to data analysis.

* 10 or more years of directly relevant experience, perhaps in a government agency like NASA, NOAA or the FDA or in the private sector (like an insurance, life science, biotech, or consumer products company).

* Must have managed staff but also have a high degree of self-sufficiency.

* Presentation skill is essential --- the ability to create and deliver compelling calls to action and updates both in person and via web conference. That also means high levels of verbal acuity and strong command of written English, in addition to persuasive communication skills.

* H1-b may be considered if there are at least 5 years left on the visa. This point is non-negotiable.

* Client offers large company benefits, very competitive compensation including both cash and stock bonus opportunities.

Both the client and their parent company have offices in Manhattan; frequent travel between both.
